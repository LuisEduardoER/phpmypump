Hi developers, have you ever needed to **pump some data into a mysql table** but
you don't want to lose time manually executing queries, then, **phpMyPump** can help you.

Just open phpmypump.php and change the 4 basic parameters for connecting to your mysql host.

Then choose a table from the drop down menu and go pump some data into it.

**Read carefully the wiki regarding all the data supported.**

**Never use phpMyPump on a production server. It's only a developer tool!**
